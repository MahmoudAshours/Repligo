# Repligo
(Write-Through Caching with Master-Slave Architecture in Go)

A fault-tolerant distributed caching system implementing write-through caching with master-slave replication, built in Go.

## Overview

This project implements a distributed caching system with write-through semantics and a master-slave architecture to ensure fault tolerance. The system guarantees data consistency across nodes while providing high-performance read operations through distributed caching.

## Project Objectives

- Implement a fault-tolerant distributed caching system using Go
- Create a write-through caching mechanism with master-slave replication
- Ensure data consistency across all nodes
- Provide automatic failover in case of master node failure
- Design a clean API for client interaction
- Achieve high performance for read operations through distributed caching

## System Architecture

### Master Node
- Primary data storage node
- Handles all write operations
- Coordinates replication to slave nodes
- Manages consistency across the system
- Detects and reports system health

### Slave Nodes
- Read-only replicas of master data
- Serve read operations to distribute load
- Periodically sync with master to ensure consistency
- Eligible for promotion to master role during failover

### Write-Through Cache Layer
- Intercepts write operations
- Ensures data is written to master first
- Propagates updates to all slave nodes
- Provides consistency guarantees

### Fault Detection and Recovery
- Health checking between nodes
- Leader election protocol for master failover
- Recovery mechanisms for failed nodes
- Log synchronization for rejoining nodes

### Client API
- Connection pooling to distributed nodes
- Automatic routing of operations (writes to master, reads to slaves)
- Configurable consistency levels
- Transparent failover handling

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Architecture
- Design the basic node structure
- Implement communication protocols between nodes
- Create basic key-value storage interface
- Set up master-slave replication mechanism

### Phase 2: Write-Through Caching
- Implement write operations flow
- Ensure data is written to master first
- Set up synchronous/asynchronous replication options
- Add consistency verification mechanisms

### Phase 3: Fault Tolerance
- Implement health checking system
- Create leader election protocol
- Design automatic failover mechanism
- Add node recovery procedures

### Phase 4: Client Interface
- Design clean, simple API
- Implement connection pooling
- Add intelligent request routing
- Create observability hooks (metrics, logging)

### Phase 5: Testing and Optimization
- Performance benchmarking
- Stress testing under various failure scenarios
- Optimization of data transfer between nodes
- Documentation and examples

## Technical Considerations

### Consistency Models
The system will offer configurable consistency levels to balance between strong consistency and performance based on application needs.

### Data Partitioning
For horizontal scaling, the architecture includes data partitioning strategies to distribute data across multiple master-slave clusters.

### Conflict Resolution
The system implements conflict resolution strategies to handle edge cases in distributed environments.

### Network Partitioning
The design accounts for network partitions with clear CAP theorem tradeoffs.

### Performance Optimization
- Efficient data serialization for network transfer
- Options for disk-based persistence vs. in-memory storage
- Connection pooling and request batching

### Security
- Node-to-node authentication
- Optional encryption for data in transit
- Access control for client operations

## Go Implementation Details

The implementation leverages Go's strengths for distributed systems:

- Goroutines and channels for concurrent processing
- Context package for operation timeouts and cancellation
- Standard library networking for inter-node communication
- Sync primitives for efficient concurrent access
- Graceful shutdown procedures
- Go modules for dependency management
- Idiomatic Go error handling

## Testing Strategy

The project includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for node interactions
- Chaos testing to verify fault tolerance
- Performance benchmarks for throughput and latency
- Race condition detection using Go's built-in race detector
